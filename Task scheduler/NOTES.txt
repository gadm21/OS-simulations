I've noticed that preemptive schedulars are almost always better than non-preemtive schedulars.
I think this has to do with the fact that we don't consider swiching time in this simulator. So, I added an option to enter the switching time to be applied on preemptive schedulars.
to create the executable : make schedular
to run the executable: ./schedular <inputfile> <quantum> <switching time>
<inputfile> : the current input file is called "input.txt"
<quantum> : affects only the RR schedular and can only be a positive integer 
<switching time> :  (optional) affects only preemtive schedulars and can be a positive integer or a positive float

the output is produced in a file called "output.out"
